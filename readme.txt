SRCSET responsive images on wordpress for content images.

== Description ==

In short, this plugin modifies "the_content()" and the post thumbnail function by re-rendering the images with use of the SRCSET attribute. Other plugins do this for templated images, but not in the content region itself. This plugin will allow for on-the-fly image resizing to the new size needed, and will automaticall work with any previously uploaded images as well.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `post-script-responsive` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Changelog ==
= 1.0.0 =
- Initial release
= 1.0.1 =
- Quick Fix of Typo
= 1.0.2 =
- Added Support for Post Thumbnail SRCSET
